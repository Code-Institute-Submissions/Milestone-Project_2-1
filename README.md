# One More Team

This website will serve the purpose of helping football fans to be able to conveniently get relevant information on
the team they support. The aim will also be to gives fans the chance to compare two teams beside one another from different leagues, and
support the longer-term goal of the website to give fans one more team to support. The website will inform users about:
* Information on any team they search for (league standing, next game, contact information, club website)
* Compiled data on teams and their league performances overv the past 3 years
* What team they could support, based on how their team performs vs. a foreign team with similar league performance

By looking to engage fans to support more than one team, this can help make the sport more exciting for the fan in terms of more sports content
to follow. In terms of commerical opportunties, this can bring potential in drawing in new, foreign fan bases for teams and support globalization
of sport. This would all be done by providing two search functions - one to check current league perormance and next game information, and the other
providing a way to compare two teams based on league performance over the last 3 years.

### Business goals:
* To provide a new revenue streams for sport teams/clubs by providing a new way to obtain international fan bases
* By providing new revenue streams for sports teams/clubs, subsequently would look to obtain revenue in the form of commission in providing
potential new customers/fans

### Goals of users/sports fans:
* To conveniently and efficiently check up on relevant information on the team(s) they support
* To give inspiration for choosing a team in another geographic league to support
* To conveniently be able to redirect themselves to team/club websites for more information and/or commerical offerings

#### Why this website is a great solution:
* Currently in the football industry there is no clear advisor for fans who would want to add to the teams(s) they support
* Curious fans and/or fans who live and work abroad do not have any real basis/support in finding a team to follow in the new country they reside in
* The solution can contribute towards greater globalisation of the sport, helping football teams/clubs themselves to become more international
* More international fans can lead to new streams of commerical activity for foreign leagues and teams (through advertising game broadcasting, merchandise etc.)
