# One More Team

This website will serve the purpose of helping sports fans (soccer fans initially) to be able to conveniently get relevant information on
the team they support. The aim will also be to gives fans the chance to compare two teams beside one another from different leagues, and
support the longer-term goal of the website to give fans one more team to support. The website will inform users about:
* Information on any team they search for (league standing, next game, contact information, club website)
* Compiled data on teams and their league performances overv the past 3 years
* What team they could support, based on how their team performs vs. a foreign team with similar league performance

By looking to engage fans to support more than one team, this can help make the sport more exciting for the fan in terms of more sports content
to follow. In terms of commerical opportunties, this can bring potential in drawing in new, foreign fan bases for teams and support globalization
of sport. This would all be done by providing two search functions - one to check current league perormance and next game information, and the other
providing a way to compare two teams based on league performance over the last 3 years.
