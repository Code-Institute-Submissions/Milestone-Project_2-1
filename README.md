# One More Team

This website will serve the purpose of helping football fans to be able to conveniently get relevant information on
the team they support. The aim will also be to gives fans the chance to compare two teams beside one another from different leagues, and
support the longer-term goal of the website to give fans one more team to support. The website will inform users about:
* Information on any team they search for (league standing, next game, contact information, club website)
* Compiled data on teams and their league performances overv the past 3 years
* What team they could support, based on how their team performs vs. a foreign team with similar league performance

By looking to engage fans to support more than one team, this can help make the sport more exciting for the fan in terms of more sports content
to follow. In terms of commerical opportunties, this can bring potential in drawing in new, foreign fan bases for teams and support globalization
of sport. This would all be done by providing two search functions - one to check current league perormance and next game information, and the other
providing a way to compare two teams based on league performance over the last 3 years.

### Business goals:
* To provide a new revenue streams for sport teams/clubs by providing a new way to obtain international fan bases
* By providing new revenue streams for sports teams/clubs, subsequently would look to obtain revenue in the form of commission in providing
potential new customers/fans
* To build an exciting application for the developer's portfolio, this being an idea he'll want to develop further in the future

### Goals of users/sports fans:
* To conveniently and efficiently check up on relevant information on the team(s) they support
* To give inspiration for choosing a team in another geographic region to support

## UX

### Ideal User

#### Users visiting my website would be:
* From anyone in the world
* A football fan
* English speaking

#### Users on my website will want to:
* Get inspiration for another team to support in a foreign league
* Have an efficient and convenient way on updating themsleves on a given team's league performance
* Be directed to where they can find more information on a given team(s)

#### Why this website is a great solution:
* Currently in the football industry there is no clear advisor for fans who would want to add to the teams(s) they support
* Curious fans and/or fans who live and work abroad do not have any basis/support in finding a team to follow in the new country they reside in
* The solution can contribute towards greater globalisation of the sport, helping football teams/clubs themselves to become more international
* More international fans can lead to new streams of commerical activity for foreign leagues and teams (through advertising game broadcasting, merchandise etc.)

### Design Choices

#### Inspiration:
https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/9-essential-sport-web-design-features/
This blog post inspired a number of my style choices when creating the website/application.

#### Font
Sans-serif was my font of choice, as it is a font that is easy to read and allows users to focus more on the other design aspects 
and functionality of the website.

#### Icons
I used Font Awesome icons for my social media link icons in my footer - this being a visually appealing way to indicate to 
users how to access website-related social media pages

#### Colours

https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/10-gorgeous-color-schemes-for-websites?kw=&gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjcfzBRCHARIsAO-1_OrJR392xwRrdV2yWgI1RkCL5Vk_T44YppPBg32ONw8TTXwgM-ysdQYaAlm_EALw_wcB

I drew inspiration from this website for my colour scheme that ended up predominately following the SCUBA theme, consisting of coral, 
ice blue, grey and teal. I felt this colour scheme could effectively draw the user’s focus better on the main parts of the 
website/application. These main aspects included the call to actions to direct users through the application journey as well as highlighting
the main team match-up feature.

#### Hero Header section

Drawing from the main sport website inspiration blog post, videos as backgrounds were suggested and I felt this would have 
a positive impact on users first arriving to the website. The call to action follows the recommendation of what is common for 
good websites in general to ensure good UX performance. In terms of implementing the video background, I used this Youtube 
video for inspiration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy3GlrddZFI. The actual video itself I obtained as a free stock video 
from Pexels.com.

#### Information Section

Followed inspiration for design from this Youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuOVuLrjioM. This design is for service 
information on a website. Since I felt that the application that’s on offer is a type of service, I felt this design could be a 
good way to explain the concept to users as easily as possible. Especially, since the concept is new for football fans, I felt 
it was very important to have a design that can clearly convey information. The bolder call to action helps direct users further 
on to the next section once they’re done reading. Hover animations on the information boxes helps users to focus on a particular 
section they’re reading.

#### Team Match-Up Section

I used the attention-grabbing colours of my chosen colour scheme (coral, teal) to emphasize this section and feature, to inform 
users that this is the main feature of the user experience to engage with. To give an easy reading experience for users, I chose 
a white background for the team stats and graphs once they’ve appeared. These phase into the page through a slide-down animation 
to give users a smooth transition from selection to results displaying. I replicated many styles from the information section, 
changing only the colours, in order to give the website a more consistent feel.
